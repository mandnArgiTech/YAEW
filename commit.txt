Git Commit Summary - YAEW Schematic Editor Improvements

## Major Features Added

### 1. Component Rotation and Mirroring System
- Added Ctrl+R for 90-degree clockwise rotation
- Added Ctrl+Shift+R for 90-degree counterclockwise rotation  
- Added Ctrl+Alt+R for 180-degree rotation
- Added Ctrl+M for horizontal mirroring
- Added Ctrl+Shift+M for vertical mirroring
- Implemented transform-based mirroring in BaseComponent class
- Added menu actions for all rotation and mirroring functions

### 2. Grid System Overhaul
- Replaced grid lines with grid dots for cleaner appearance
- Implemented configurable grid spacing based on component dimensions
- Added automatic grid snapping for all components
- Made grid dots thinner and more subtle (1px pen, 1px radius)
- Changed grid color to light gray for better visibility
- Removed grid coordinate display for cleaner interface

### 3. Component Configuration System
- Created JSON-based component configuration (component_config.json)
- Implemented ConfigManager singleton for centralized settings
- Added ConfigurableComponent base class for dimension-driven components
- Made component dimensions, terminals, and SVG settings configurable
- Added grid alignment settings per component type
- Implemented automatic SVG scaling based on component dimensions

### 4. Terminal Alignment System
- Fixed fundamental terminal alignment with grid dots
- Implemented perfect grid snapping for component placement
- Added automatic terminal positioning based on component configuration
- Ensured terminals align exactly with grid dots (30-mil grid spacing)
- Fixed AddComponentCommand to snap components to grid

### 5. Selection and Visual Improvements
- Replaced Qt's default red selection rectangle with custom blue dotted outline
- Implemented transparent blue selection indicator
- Added debug information toggle (configurable, default disabled)
- Improved component visual appearance and selection feedback

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
- main.py: Added rotation/mirror shortcuts, config editor integration
- components/base.py: Added mirror functionality, improved grid snapping
- components/configurable_component.py: New base class for configurable components
- components/resistor.py: Updated to use ConfigurableComponent
- ui/schematic_scene.py: Grid dots rendering, coordinate display removal
- ui/canvas_settings.py: Grid size calculation for component alignment
- ui/command_system.py: Added grid snapping to AddComponentCommand
- config/component_config.json: Component configuration definitions

### Key Technical Improvements:
- Grid spacing: 30 mils (half component width) for perfect terminal alignment
- Terminal positions: ±30 mils from component center
- SVG scaling: fit_within_bounds with aspect ratio maintenance
- Transform system: Proper rotation and mirroring support
- Configuration-driven: All component properties now configurable

## Configuration Changes

### Component Configuration (component_config.json):
- Resistor: 60x60 mils, terminals at ±30 mils
- Grid alignment: component_based
- SVG scaling: fit_within_bounds
- Debug info: disabled by default

### Grid System:
- Spacing: 30 mils (matches terminal offset)
- Visual: Light gray dots, 1px thickness
- Snapping: Always enabled for components
- Alignment: Perfect terminal-to-grid alignment

## User Experience Improvements

### Keyboard Shortcuts:
- Ctrl+R: Rotate 90° clockwise
- Ctrl+Shift+R: Rotate 90° counterclockwise
- Ctrl+Alt+R: Rotate 180°
- Ctrl+M: Mirror horizontally
- Ctrl+Shift+M: Mirror vertically

### Visual Enhancements:
- Clean grid dots instead of lines
- Subtle selection indicators
- Perfect component alignment
- Professional schematic appearance
- Configurable debug information

## Bug Fixes

### Terminal Alignment:
- Fixed terminals appearing between grid dots
- Implemented proper grid spacing calculation

- Added custom blue dotted selection outline
- Improved visual feedback for selected components
- Fixed selection appearance issues

## Performance Improvements

### Rendering:
- Optimized grid dot rendering
- Removed unnecessary coordinate text rendering
- Improved SVG scaling performance
- Better visual hierarchy

### Configuration:
- Centralized configuration management
- Efficient component dimension calculation
- Optimized grid snapping algorithms

## Future-Ready Architecture

### Extensibility:
- Easy addition of new component types
- Configurable component properties
- Flexible grid system
- Modular configuration system

### Maintainability:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Centralized configuration
- Consistent component architecture
- Well-documented code structure
